This application is a banking interest calculator that I developed using C++. I am proud of the work I put into this project, and I believe I created classes that are both efficient and effective. By using two different classes, I was able to create a more readable and organized codebase.

However, I do recognize that there is still room for improvement. One area where I could improve is in better handling of user inputs that are incorrect or invalid. I acknowledge that this is a crucial aspect of any application, and I intend to address it in future updates.

Despite this, I am confident that my use of classes has made the code more readable and maintainable. Additionally, I have added comments throughout the code to make it more understandable to anyone who may need to work with it in the future.

In summary, this banking interest calculator is the result of a lot of hard work and dedication. While there is always room for improvement, I believe that I have created a solid foundation that can be built upon in the future.
